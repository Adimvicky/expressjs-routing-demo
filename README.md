# expressjs-routing-demo

### An Express.JS  blog app for my talk - "Server-side Routing with Express" at Code Club PH

To get this app to run on your local machine, you must have node.js installed. Go ahead and clone the repo directly on GitHub. OR using your terminal, run..

$ git clone https://github.com/Adimvicky/expressjs-routing-demo

Either of the above will clone the app on your local machine. Next..

$ cd expressjs-routing-demo

..and  then run

$ npm install

This will install the required packages for the app. Then run..

$ node app.js 

To get the app running on your localhost (port 3000)

Cheers!
